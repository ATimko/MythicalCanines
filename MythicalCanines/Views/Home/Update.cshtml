<h3>What's New?</h3>

<p> - Added a ability to all classes called fusion classes.<br /> Fusion classes are classes that the K9's can obtain when you have two classes unlocked.<br />
    For example if you're an thief and a mage You can still be a thief with mage powers or a mage with thief powers. The original class moves will still be useable.<br />
